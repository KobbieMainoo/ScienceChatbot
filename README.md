# :sparkles: ScienceChatbot
ScienceChatbot contains a full-stack educational visual reasoning chatbot based on Qwen3-VL. We fine-tune models on the ScienceQA dataset for multimodal question answering and explanation generation, and provide a front-end and back-end pipeline for image-based student question solving.
## :rocket: About
ScienceChatbot presents an educational multimodal large language model system designed for multimodal question answering and reasoning in science-learning scenarios for students from elementary school to high school. The system is fine-tuned on the ScienceQA dataset and supports image-based problem input, answer prediction, and explanation generation.

The goal of this project is to bridge vision language model (VLM) with real-world educational applications, enabling students to upload question images (e.g., science diagrams, charts) and receive both the correct answer and detailed explanations.

The repository includes:

*Model fine-tuning and evaluation code based on ScienceQA
*Multimodal inference pipeline
*Frontend interface for image upload and interaction
*Backend service for model deployment and API integration

This work focuses on multimodal reasoning, answer prediction, and explanation generation for science visual question answering tasks.
